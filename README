Overview
--------
CHIP-8 SDL is a CHIP-8/SCHIP cross-platform interpreter/emulator written in C++11 utilizing SDL for input and
media output.


Project History
---------------
Sept. 25, 2012
   Initial release (0.1b).

Dec. 09, 2014
   Removed configure script and any autoconf files.
   Edited makefile to use a directory tree of src, obj, and bin.
   No code changes.

Mar. 15, 2015
   Merged in development branch with the beginnings of a rewrite of the program
   to C++11. Emulator is not in a usable state yet, but there are some unit tests.
   
Command-line Usage (not currently supported)
--------------------
usage: chip8sdl [--scale=<int>] [--freq=<int>] [--background=<int>] [--foreground=<int>] [--help] [<file>]

  --scale=<int>       set how much to scale the video (default 4)
  --freq=<int>        set how many instructions per second (default 800)
  --background=<int>  set background color in format 0xRRGGBB (default 0x000000)
  --foreground=<int>  set foreground color in format 0xRRGGBB (default 0xFFFFFF)
  --help              print this help and exit
  <file>              input file (game)


Controls (not currently supported)
--------
Computers running CHIP-8 originally used a 16-key hexidecimal
keypad laid out like:

1 2 3 C
4 5 6 D
7 8 9 E
A 0 B F

which is mapped to the keyboard like this

1 2 3 4
q w e r
a s d f
z x c v

The Esc key can be pressed at any time to exit CHIP-8 SDL.


Compiling
---------
Dependencies
   g++ 4.7 or later (for -std=c++11 argument).
   g++ 4.3 may work as well (with -std=c++0x argument)

Compilation procedure
   make

This will create an executable called chip8tests in the bin directory.

Running 'make test' will execute the unit tests.
